- ðŸ‘‹ Heyo, my name is Josh Stim. My experiences with applying various statistical tools (e.g., independent component analysis, linear regression) and mathematical tools (e.g., fast fourier transform, topographic interpolation) to process and analyze neural time series data in a clinical neuroscience lab has made me really curious about how these tools actually work (i.e., what assumptions are made, what do the outputs really mean, how are they derived?). Unfortunately, when I try to do extra learning, I'm almost immediately met with a "math wall"... i.e., math that is way over my head (beyond AP calc 1). While frustrating, I firmly believe this "wall" is surmountable through an organized learning approach.
- As of now, I am taking sophomore-level math and statistics courses at a local university, and supplementing this with programming courses through edx and coursera. I've created this repository to store my notes and projects for specific courses and to document my overall progress towards better quantitative literacy.
